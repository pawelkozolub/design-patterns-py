## Design patterns

### Strategy

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern. It selects an appropriate algorithm for solving a problem depending on a particular case and conditions.

Application consequences:
- Automatic or manual algorithm selection.
- Additional layer for an algorithm choosing.
- Eliminates if conditions at client side.
- Same result is expected.
- Individual class or function need to be created for each algorithm.
